======================== Chat GPT:
Given an array of numbers, find and print the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

Write a program that takes a positive integer 'n' as input and prints a pattern of numbers in 
the form of a pyramid.

Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number 'n' up to a certain 
range.

Write a program that generates and prints all the prime numbers up to a given number 'n'.

Given a positive integer 'n', write a program to determine whether it is a perfect number. 
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors 
(excluding itself).

Given an array of numbers, write a program to find and print the second smallest and second 
largest numbers in the array.

Write a program that takes a positive integer 'n' as input and prints the Pascal's 
Triangle up to 'n' rows.

===================== Think like a programmer: 
If you like the Luhn formula problem, try writing a program for a different check-digit
system, like the 13-digit ISBN system. The program could take an identification number
and verify it or take a number without its check digit and generate the check digit. 

If youâ€™ve learned about binary numbers and how to convert from decimal to binary and the
reverse, try writing programs to do those conversions with unlimited length numbers (but
you can assume the numbers are small enough to be stored in a standard C++ int). 

Have you learned about hexadecimal? Try writing a program that lets the user specify an
input in binary, decimal, or hexadecimal, and output in any of the three. 

Want an extra challenge? Generalize the code for the previous exercise to make a program
that converts from any number base-16 or less to any other number base. So, for example,
the program could convert from base-9 to base-4. 

Write a program that reads a string, counting the number of words, identifying the
length of the longest word, the greatest number of vowels and consonants in a word, and/or
any other statistics you can think of.
