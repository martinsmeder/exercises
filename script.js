// Don't forget functional programming concepts (pure functions and immutability)!

// And write down notes about composition and when it's useful

// composition 1: Data Transformation Pipeline:
// Given an array of numbers, create a function composition pipeline that
// first filters out the even numbers, then squares each remaining number,
// and finally calculates the sum of the squared numbers.

// =========================================================================

// composition 2: String Formatting and Transformation:
// Start with an array of strings. Create a function composition that
// first filters out strings with less than 5 characters, then capitalizes
// the remaining strings, and finally concatenates all the strings into a
// single string.

// =========================================================================

// composition 3: Processing User Profiles:
// Imagine you have an array of user objects with properties like name,
// age, and isAdmin. Create a function composition that filters out users
// who are not admins, then extracts the names of the remaining admin users,
// and finally sorts the names in alphabetical order.

// =========================================================================
