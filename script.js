// Don't forget functional programming concepts (pure functions and immutability)!

// callbacks 1: Timer
// Write a function that takes a duration in milliseconds and a callback
// function as arguments. The function should wait for the specified duration
// and then execute the callback function.

// =========================================================================

// callbacks 2: Parallel Async Operations
// Write a function that takes an array of URLs and a callback function as
// arguments. The function should make asynchronous requests to each URL and
// collect the responses. Once all requests are complete, the callback function
// should be executed with the collected responses as an array.

// =========================================================================

// callbacks 3: API Request with Callbacks
// Make an API request to a JSON placeholder API
// (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) using the axios library
// (or any other library of your choice) to fetch a list of posts. Implement
// a function that takes a callback function and performs the API request.
// Once the data is fetched, the callback function should be executed with the
// fetched data.
